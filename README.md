Starling 1.4.1 Dash docset
==============

This is my first attempt at creating a docset for [Dash](http://kapeli.com/dash) included in this repository are  
  
Starling docset: starling.docset    
Ruby Generation Script: populateIndex.rb  
Dash document feed files: Starling.xml, starling.tgz  
Starling docs generated with ASDOC: starlingdocs  
Build Script: build.sh  
  
To install the document feed please use the below link and press install, your browser will open dash and subscribe to the feed.  
  
[http://nicholasjackson.github.io/starlingdocset](http://nicholasjackson.github.io/starlingdocset)  
  
At present only classes, methods, properties and constants are included however I plan to add the rest of the documentation when I find time.
